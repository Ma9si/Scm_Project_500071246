# Scm_Project_500071246

First make know the number branch and create project.cpp file.
Make commits in know the numbers branch.
Then created a new branch named array and make commits in same file.
Merge this branch into know the number branch.
then again create string branch which includes string functions and make commits.
mMerge this branch into know the number branch after resolving some conflicts.
Create another branch named stack which includes implementation of stack by making stack header file in another file.
Again create conversions branch which includes all type of conversions in project.cpp file which are added by one of my contributor.
Merge stack branch into conversions after resolving some conflicts.
Then merge conversions branch into array branch.
Then shivani contributes in my array branch by adding some pointers function.
Karan contributes afterwards in array branch and add some basic c++ function in same file.
Then main function is added and the whole program is made.
At the end, array branch is merged into master branch.
